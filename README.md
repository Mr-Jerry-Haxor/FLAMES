   # FLAMES

   FLAMES stands for:
   - **F** - Friendship
   - **L** - Love
   - **A** - Affection
   - **M** - Marriage
   - **E** - Enemy
   - **S** - Sister (Sibling)

   ### Example:
   **Your name:** asd  
   **Your Partner's name:** abcd

   1. **Get the FLAMES count:**
      - Take the two names (asd and abcd).
      - Remove the common characters (two common characters: a, d).
      - Get the count of the characters that are left (Removed a, d and the rest are s, b, c. So total 3).

   2. **Get the FLAMES result:**
      - We take FLAMES letters ('F', 'L', 'A', 'M', 'E', 'S').
      - Start removing letters using the FLAMES count we got.
      - The letter which lasts the process is the result.
